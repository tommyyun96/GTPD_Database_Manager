Around 9:50pm Mr. Islas girlfriend noticed there was glass on the ground next to the vehicle. As she began to approach the vehicle she discovered that the rear passenger window was shattered out. Mr. Islas advised he then went around to the driver side and discovered the front driver door lock was damaged as well as the handle and the door. Mr. Islas explained how he had a black briefcase that had "Primerica" embroidered on it that was missing from the rear passenger seat along with a blue and black bookbag with notes, some dress shoes and a silver Apple Ipad (serial number unknown).I went inside and spoke to the manager, Mr. Elton Francis, who already had video surveillance available to view. Video surveillance shows a blue in color Kia enter the parking garage around 9:33pm with what appears to be four black males and parks in front of Mr. Islas vehicle. A male exits the vehicle from the rear driver side and begins looking into parked vehicles. The driver of the Kia then pulls the vehicle up and his driver side door is next to Mr. Islas driver side door. The driver then exits the vehicle and begins to look inside the vehicle with a flashlight, all while the other male is still looking into other vehicles. An unknown vehicle then enters the parking deck and the driver gets back into his vehicle and moves his vehicle into a parking space. The male who was outside looking into vehicles then enters into the vehicle as well. After a few minutes inside the vehicle another unknown male from the rear passenger side exits the vehicle and approaches Mr. Islas driver side door. The male appears to break the driver lock and an unknown piece falls onto the ground. Another male exits the Kia and appears to look around as the male is still at the driver door. The male is unable to access the vehicle through the driver door so video shows him going back to the Kia while the "lookout" male attempts at the driver door. The male comes back from the Kia and approaches the rear passenger window and reaches in and grabs something out. The male goes back to the Kia and then goes back to Mr. Islas vehicle for a second time and again takes something from the vehicle. Both males enter in the rear passenger seat of the Kia and drive off at 9:40pm. Mr. Francis stated video may be obtained by the General Manager Mr. Lezzon Miller (404-892-0892) during regular business hours.

Brown was patrolling the area of 768 MARRIETTA ST NW when we noticed a GRAY HONDA ACCORD parked illegally on the curb. 	Once we approached the vehicle a female exited an establishment near the parked vehicle and announced that the GRAY HONDA ACCORD was her vehicle. I, SPO Coffin requested her drivers license which identified the female to be Ms. DANASHA N. SMITH. Then I ran her Georgia OLN through our system and at that time the system informed us of her Failure to Appear Warrant # 19TR123901 of out the City of Atlanta. I exited my patrol vehicle and detained SMITH and temporarily placed her in the back of my vehicle while I confirmed the warrant with ACIC. Ofc. Williams arrived on scene as the female unit working the watch and perform a search of Smith person. Smith informed us of having marijuana on her hip within the waist band of her underwear. With the search complete we transported SMITH to City Jail. 	SGT. Brooks ( unit # ) was notified of the situation. SMITH allowed her mother Ms. OLIVIA D. BLACKBURN to take her cell phone and remove her vehicle from the scene. Smith was cited for 40-6-203 ( illegally Parked ), 106-182 ( Marijuana ), and for her Warrant #19TR123901.', 0, 0.0, '18:37:00', '18:37:00', 'Eve', 3.0, 'Tue'),(200321263, '0N', 0, 5, 503, '2020-02-01 00:00:00', 640, '125 10TH ST NE', NULL, NULL, '2020-02-01 00:00:00', '10:36:00', '2020-02-01 00:00:00', '15:00:00', 6775, NULL, 'HUNTER, D ', 'OFFICERS', 61.0, 'LARCENY-FROM VEHICLE', NULL, 61.0, 'LARCENY-FROM VEHICLE', 'On Feb 1st, 2020, I, Officer D.
